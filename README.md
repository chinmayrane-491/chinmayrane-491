ordering system aims to replace the manual Method of taking orders with a digital one. Theability to rapidly and correctly create order Summary reports whenever necessary is a keyfactor in the development of this project.

2) Kashiram Cakse Shop: The project ‚ÄúKashiram Cake Shop‚Äù allows users to check for various Cakes available at the online store and purchase online. The project consists of list of Cakes displayed in various categories. The user may browse through these items as per categories. If the user likes a product he may add it to his shopping cart. Once user wishes to checkout he must register on the site first. He can then login using same id password next time. Now he may pay through a credit card or cash on delivery. Once the user makes a successful transaction he gets a copy of the shopping receipt. This project is simple, quick, and precise. There is less disk space needed. MySQL server is used as the backbone by the ‚ÄúKashiram Cake Shop‚Äù system, eliminating the risk of data loss and ensuring data security.
