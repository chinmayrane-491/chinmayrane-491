#### Projects
Here are a few projects I‚Äôm proud of:

1) Kashiram Fast Food : The project ‚ÄúKashiram Fast Food‚Äù allows users to check for various Food Items available at the online store and purchase online. The project consists of list of Food Items displayed in various categories. The user may browse through these items as per categories. If the user likes a product he may add it to his shopping cart. Once user wishes to checkout he must register on the site first. He can then login using same id password next time. Now he may pay through a credit card or cash on delivery. Once the user makes a successful transaction he gets a copy of the shopping receipt. This project is simple, quick, and precise. There is less disk space needed. MySQL server is used as the backbone by the ‚ÄúKashiram Fast Food‚Äù system, eliminating the risk of data loss and ensuring data security.
